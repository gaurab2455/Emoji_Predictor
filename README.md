# Emoji_Predictor
Emoji usage has become a new form of social communication, which is important because it can help to improve communication systems, such as chat applications. In this project we provide our model with some sentences which then predicts the emoji most associated with it. 

## Highlights of Model
- Used Emojify_data dataset provided by Kaggle.
- Processed Text using the concept of Transfer learning.
- Built over pre-trained GloVe 6B.50d(consist of 6 billion words represented as a 50 dimension vector).
- Used concepts of Deep learning such as RNN, and LSTM.
